# Summary

This summary provides an overview of the **Canadian Financial Markets Forecasting** project. The project uses official data from the Bank of Canada (CAD/USD exchange rate and CORRA benchmark interest rate) and market data from Yahoo Finance (S&P/TSX Composite index) to build short‑term forecasting models using Prophet and ARIMA.

The goal is to support currency hedging, interest rate risk management and investment planning by generating accurate 30‑day and 90‑day forecasts for each series. Models were evaluated on a recent hold‑out set, achieving a mean absolute error of about **0.0085** on CAD/USD predictions. The 90‑day outlook suggests relative stability in the CAD/USD exchange rate and a modest upward trend for the TSX index.
